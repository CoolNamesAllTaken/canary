  p Understanding local bird populations can help ecologists detect environmental changes early on. Research groups like the Cornell Lab of Orinthology track bird population health, but it can be very difficult to gather large amounts of reliable data. That's where "crowd-sourcing" (and you!) come in. 
  p Citizen scientists can help researchers track and monitor birds, and automatic systems like Canary can gather large amounts of high-quality research data without the challenges associated with human monitoring.
